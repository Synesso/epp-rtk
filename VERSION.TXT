EPP RTK Java Versions
======================
epp-rtk-java-0.9.7 - Feb 2, 2011

 + Various C++ compiler compatibility changes.
 + Fixed issue with ContactExample and DomainExample not transferring properly.

epp-rtk-java-0.9.6 - Aug 10, 2009

 + Made changes to EPP RTK to fix a bug.
   
epp-rtk-java-0.9.5 - May 18, 2007

 + Made changes to EPPXMLBase.java to fix a bug 
   when sending more than one extension

epp-rtk-java-0.7.5 - Dec 24, 2003

 + In epp02, improvement was made to parsing unspec elements 
   in response from server. Old code only parsed the first 
   unspec subelement, the rest were ignored.  New code 
   parses them all and put them all together in the same 
   m_unspec_string.  This update is only noteworthy for 
   registrars who will use IDNs for .info and still use 
   trademark info for domain names.
 + Also made epp02 code more tolerant of missing trid
   elements in error responses from server.

epp-rtk-java-0.7.4 - Sept 10, 2003

 + Added usage of ssl.keystore.format property to epp02's
   EPPClient (backport from EPPTransportTCPTLS in epp0705)
 + Added addition of BounyCastle security provider if the 
   keystore format is BC
 + Added createXMLSnippetFromDoc() to epp02's EPPXMLBase
   needed for new RGPRenew liberty-rtk-addon unspec
   class

epp-rtk-java-0.7.3 - Sept 2, 2003

 + Fixed pattern string for UTC simple date formats.  Was
   using "hh" for hours, but this only accepts 1-12. "HH"
   accepts 0-23.
 + Added null check for the children of value nodes.
   Received reports of NPE's when parsing some responses
   from the .cn registry.
 + Changed epp02,epp0402,epp0503,epp0604 to get a named
   log4j logger and not the root loggers.  epp0705 
   was already doing this.

epp-rtk-java-0.7.2 - May 5, 2003

 + Fixed the build scrips to include the bouncy castle jar file
 + Made the RTK tolerant of missing properties, uses internal
   defaults for missing values: debug level=1; transport=tcptls;
   advancedlogging=false
 + Replaced the array manipulation for address in EPPContactInfo
   with an ArrayList, and then convert it to an array afterwards --
   this is consistent with building of the contact status array.
 + Made at least get/setAddresses() set of accessors for the 
   addresses not deprecated in epp_ContactInfoRsp
 + In TCPTLS transport, now checking to see if the connection 
   was successfully established for some reason ssl handshake 
   exceptions don't make it to us, so we have to probe the socket
 + Fix to transfer status values for a bug reported on the devel
   list by M Schout

epp-rtk-java-0.7.1 - April 11, 2003

 + Merged in bug fixes from custom 0.7.0 for Afilias
   (includes: fixes to EPPGreeting in parsing the
   dcp data; fixes to XML rendering of extensions;
   upgrade xerces to 1.4.4; fixed auth info xml
   rendering to be compliant with the syntax; fixes
   and minor improvements to the examples)
 + Using BouncyCastle provider for PKCS12 keystore
 + Updated the ssl directory with newer example key 
   and cert and moved old ssl stuff to ssl/old-ssl

epp-rtk-java-0.7.0 - March 24, 2003

 + Initial Java RTK release for EPP 07/05
   + Removed the EPP status command.
   + AuthInfo now has EXT type, in addition
     to PW.
   + Removed "ResultData" from EPP response.
   + Created new epp_ExtResultValue IDL class.
   + Removed credentials class and moved its
     data members to the Login request. (EPP
     no longer supports sessionless interactions).
   + Added new 1001 response code -- command 
     completed successfully.
   + Changed constant naming of the 1301, and 2500.
   + Changed meaning of 2501 reponse code.
     (Backward compatibility of response codes is provided)
   + Added pending action notification classes
     (domainpanData, contactpanData and hostpanData)
     to the xml/poll class package.
 + Renamed source packages from com.tucows.oxrs.epp.*
   to com.tucows.oxrs.epp0705.*
 + Imported in source from EPP 06/04, 05/03, 04/02,
   and "pre" 02 into current source tree.
 + Updated run_example.(sh|bat) to accept an EPP
   version number to run example code.  See usage
   for run_example for format.
 + Updates to the SSL code for compilation with
   Java SDK 1.4.
 + Upgraded to Ant 1.5.2 (to solve problems in
   javadoc generation)
 + Added usage of log4j to do debug logging
   which involved new jar, changes to rtk.properties
   and changes to all EPP versions of RTKBase class

epp-rtk-java-0.5.0 - March 20, 2002

 + Initial Java RTK release for EPP 05/03
 + Revamped polling structure and classes
 + New EPP status command
 + Restructuring to Check results -- "exists"
   terminology changes to "avail" with opposite
   boolean value.
 + "Unspec" changed to "Extension" to match EPP
   spec.
 + IDL "Type" classes (eg. epp_TransferStatusType)
   now have toString() methods to convert the
   types to String representations.

epp-rtk-java-0.4.1 - Dec 18, 2001

 + Updated examples to work with .biz registry.
 + Added overloaded version of RTKBase.setDebugLevel()
   with no params which causes the debug level to
   be read from the rtk.properties files.
 + Fixed bug with EPPHostInfo where default IP addr
   type was null and causing exceptions.
 + Now using regexp package to strip out whitespace
   in XML from server.  "include-ignorable-whitespace"
   set to false had no effect since Xerces doesn't
   have a DTD for this XML to determine which
   whitespaces are ignorable.
 + Fixed bug with unspec parsing in EPPXMLBase class.
 + Re-added setRoid() and getRoid() as deprecated
   methods for improved backward compatibility
   with the 0.3.x line of RTKs.
 + Added Javadocs to the IDL classes (epp_*).

epp-rtk-java-0.4.0 - Oct 8, 2001

 + Upgraded RTK to use EPP 04/02 (i.e. epp 04 and domain/
   contact/host 02).
 + Merged various bug fixes from the epp-pre02 branch.
 + Revamped protocol/tranport in EPPClient.  Created
   transport package and EPPTransport* classes.

epp-rtk-java-0.3.8 - July 27, 2001

 + Fixed bug in contact fax data member.  Was a String,
   is now an epp_ContactPhone instance because it
   is supposed to accept an extension value.
 + Fixed a bug in run_example.sh
 + Changed all epp_* classes to no longer be "final".
 + Updated user guide.

epp-rtk-java-0.3.7 - July 20, 2001

 + Fixed bug in EPPContactBase.addressToXML() where the
   name was always put into the XML even if it was null.
   This resulted in ContactUpdate not working if the name
   was being omitted for the reason that it wasn't changing.
 + Improved ssl README.TXT based on suggestions from
   A. Eden in devel list.
 + Verified order of XML elements in XML generating classes.
 + Updated ContactExample to work with recent .info regisry
   builds.

epp-rtk-java-0.3.6 - July 12, 2001

 + Recent changes to .info registry sends XML formatted all
   nice and pretty like.  Xerces reacted very badly to this.
   Introduced code to strip out the XML header and spaces 
   between tags in EPP messages from the server.
   This is a general fix anyhow since any registry could
   send their data with any number of \n's and spaces.
 + Small bug fix in EPPXMLBase.java where the id attribute 
   was not being retrieved.

epp-rtk-java-0.3.5 - July 3, 2001

 + Added toString() method to all the org.openrtk classes
   that have public data members.  Also added get's and
   set's for all the public data members to make the classes
   more Object Oriented.  Make then easier to use in EJB
   or JSP contexts.
 + Added Poll "resData" parsing in response.  This includes
   "domaintransfer" and "contacttransfer" responses because 
   they are the obvious ones (protocol doesn't specifically
   define any).  The framework is now there to create
   poll resData extensions (see EPPPoll and PollResData classes).
 + Added poll() methods to EPPClient.java to make it easier to
   poll the server.  Also, wessorh added isValid() and 
   getLastNetTransaction() for improved connection
   management.
 + Updated SessionExample to use EPPClient.poll().
 + Added the etc directory and the file rtk.properties.
   Currently only one property can be set right now and it
   defines a list of class packages in which to find Poll
   resData parsers.  Currently the default in EPPPoll.java
   is sufficient since no external Poll parsers have been
   created.  The RTKBase class will load the RTK properties
   if the system property "rtk.props.file" has been 
   defined.
 + Added regexp.jar from Apache's Jakarta project.  Changed
   the run_examples and the build scripts to include it
   in the class path.  The first module to use it is EPPPoll.java
 + Fixed SF bugs: 435835, 431185, 431215
 + Also create a utility class in the ssl directory to convert
   external RSA keys and x509 certs to a java keystore that the
   RTK understands.  Also added README for helpful tips and
   tricks for keys and certs.  Thanks for wessorh for the
   first tip.
 + Updated user's guide: notes on SSL and certs; added 'optional'
   markers for members of IDL classes; and more.

epp-rtk-java-0.3.4 - May 31, 2001

 + Added doc/epp-rtk-users-guide.html
 + Added run_example.bat from dankirkd
 + Updated README for run_example.sh/bat
 + Removed README section on .info and Entrust
   since they aren't using Entrust certs anymore
 + Changed EPPXMLBase.getCheckResultFor() to ignore case
   in object identifier comparison because Liberty's
   EPP server returns contact roids in all uppercase
 + Added send RTK version number on Login

epp-rtk-java-0.3.3 - May 24, 2001

 + Added code to EPPClient so that it can take in SSL
   certs.
 + Added ssl directory to CVS and to distribution which holds
   the sample certs we created.  It also holds the ssl.properties
   file which defines some variable for secure connections.

epp-rtk-java-0.3.2 - May 21, 2001

 + Bug fixes to Host and Contact status for the Info command
   and fix to Host IPs for the Info command
 + Also fixed spelling mistake in IDL and its use in the RTK
   (Thanks for steira00 for finding this.)
 + Fixes for SF bugs 425375 and 425952 (Thanks to wessorh
   for finding those)

epp-rtk-java-0.3.1 - May 11, 2001

 + Bug fixes to Transfers
 + Added public utility methods to "base" classes (eg. EPPDomainBase) which
   allow conversion from IDL type classes to string representation (eg.
   EPPDomainBase.convertStatusToString(epp_DomainStatusType) )
 + Enhanced SessionExample to be more dynamic and interact with user and to
   take advantage of the new utility methods added to the "base" classes.
 + Renamed IDL Java packages from "org.openrrc.rtk.epp..." to
   "org.openrtk.idl.epp..."
 + added epp_Unspec interface to EPP IDL.  This makes add-on creation and use
   a little more logical.
 + Created classes for Unpec interface from IDL changes
 + Changed EPPXMLBase to specify  in client requests as epp_Unspec object and
   in server responses as XML String
 + Removed Liberty API document (will be converted to text/html
   in next release(s) and made generic)

epp-rtk-java-0.3.0 - May 4, 2001

 + Updates to conform with EPP 02 pre-release
 + Updated API document

epp-rtk-java-0.2.2 - April 27, 2001

 + Updates to IDL files.

 + Added EPP 01 drafts to distribution
 + Updated API document

epp-rtk-java-0.2.1 - April 20, 2001

 + Included Java classes for RTK IDLs
 + Created SessionExample.java

epp-rtk-java-0.2 - April 18, 2001
